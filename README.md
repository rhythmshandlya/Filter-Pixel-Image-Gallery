# FilterPixel Image Gallery

The aim of this project is to create an image gallery for FilterPixel, accessible only to logged-in users.

## How it Works

1. To access the gallery, users must log in with either their Google account or by using a username & password.

2. After logging in, the images are fetched from both an S3 bucket and Google Drive.

3. Users can interact with the images, and the gallery supports pagination.
